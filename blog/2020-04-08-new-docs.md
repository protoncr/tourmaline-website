Well it's been a long time coming, but here it is. With Crystal [nearing version 1](https://crystal-lang.org/2020/04/06/crystal-0.34.0-released.html), the [recent changes to the bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#march-30-2020), and just general boredom from being stuck at home while the world goes to crap I figured there would never be a better time to create a real doc site for Tourmaline.

I'll do my best to keep this blog updated as new Telegram related stuff happens. You can expect announcements about the bot API, Crystal, and of course Tourmaline. I'll also have occasional text based tutorials here, in addition to [my video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLieekIhJ88I-dalDkZMlQddZ10oV0GzOy) that I've already been releasing.

So if Telegram is your jam, be sure to check back in frequently!
